# Jenkins

Jenkins is an open source continuous integration/continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) automationwritten in the Java programming language. It is used to implement CI/CD workflows, called pipelines.

**Pipelines** automate testing and reporting on isolated changes in a larger code base

To operate Jenkins, pipelines are created.A pipeline is a series of steps the Jenkins server will take to perform the required tasks of the CI/CD process. These are stored in a plain text ** Jenkinsfile**. The Jenkinsfile uses a curly bracket syntax that looks similar to JSON.

Plugins
A plugin is an enhancement to the Jenkins system. They help extend Jenkins capabilities and integrated Jenkins with other software. Plugins help to integrate other developer tools into the Jenkins environment, add new user interface elements to the Jenkins Web UI, help with administration of Jenkins, and enhance Jenkins for build and source code management.
